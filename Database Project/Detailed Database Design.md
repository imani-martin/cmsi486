# Detailed Database Design

### 2.1 - Project description, database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff

My database project will  I won't be designing a front end, but instead using the terminal to perform queries and test the results. For the database engine, I will be using MongoDB. I will be using the Sportradar API for access to all the NBA data that will be needeed for my database. Potential users of the system would be those who are NBA/sports fans or those who want to see data on NBA teams, and NBA player's data and stats. I made a few changes to the database schema. One change was getting rid of the coaches table and adding the coach's data into the team table. I also divided the player table into two different tables. One table called Player Info, where Player Info is more general data on a player, and the other Player Seasonal Stats, giving the player's game performance stats from the season.
