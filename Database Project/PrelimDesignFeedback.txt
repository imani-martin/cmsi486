This is nice work.  You have addessed all of the required topics.

I think there needs to be more here, even for a preliminary design.  You have
considered three entites, but haven't really addressed the starting concepts
of what their attributes are.  For example, coaches have a name, an age, and
a hometown, but what about wins and losses?  What about what teams they have
coached in the past and their records with those teams?  What will be the
primary key for that table?  For the Players, will the "number" attribute be
enough to uniquely identify every player, regardless of team?  Do both the
Lakers and the Buc's have a number 32?  What about their free-throw percentage
or their other stats?  For the team, what other attributes can you think of to
describe what people might want to know about each team?  It seems like there
could be more than just the name and city... what about which cities they have
been hosted in for other seasons?  What draft picks they have had, or their
won/lost record?

For section 1.2, I mentioned in class that this is not the "data type" of what
will be stored, like "integer".  It is supposed to list, from a user's point
of view, what *information* the data will provide, much of which I have given
you above as examples.  Try to think about these things as you proceed with
your design.

Overall, pretty good work, but I encourage you to push yourself a bit further!

you have 9% out of 10% which is 90% on this deliverable for an A-minus
