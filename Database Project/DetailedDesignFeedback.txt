You did a very nice job with this!  The data dictionary is nice and clean,
and makes sense.

Your ERD is a combination of styles, using the chen ovals with the crow's
foot associations and cardinality.  I won't make you fix it for this class,
but be aware that it's not quite the way to do things...


Overall, VERY NICE WORK!

you have 10% out of 10% which is 100% on this deliverable for an A-plus
